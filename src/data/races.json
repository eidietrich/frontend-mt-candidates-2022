On the other hand, it is the health of an economic system that moves America together, an education system that is built of instilling virtue, and a health care system that provides quality care to all Americans that is of concern. What is at stake? I will argue it is the American mind itself; that is, there is real anger, frustration, and fear among people and, as a result, we have been focused on what divides and fictitious problems of the past and what we fail to do then is properly prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. Rights in America are to be protected, but the necessary obligation to do that well comes by way of proper education and citizenship."

The winner-take-all electoral system, one built on monied interests, 24/7 news cycle, and vanishing competitive districts, have helped perpetuate the feeling that when one loses, one is robbed.

We must begin this process by changing the way we think about the issue by addressing how we speak about the issue. We are not ready for a Green New Deal, not because many do not want it, but because we lack the infrastructure to do so. We must first begin there and with those actors already involved in providing energy and sustainability."

Trade-offs are at the root of any economic decision. To pay down the debt, the government can cut spending, but that will have ripple effects throughout the economy. I would be in favor of that, with the assumption we have the proper feedback mechanisms and infrastructure in place to respond. Government can tax for the money (not likely in a representative democracy), print money (not likely due to the fear of inflation), or it can borrow (which it currently does, mainly due to the fact most do not understand how this system works). As such I would like to explore more MMT, cutting programs and replacing them with a UBI, and cut or reconfigure certain programs and departments that have over the past several decades failed (i.e., Department of Education)."

We are seeing these lands leased or sold for private interests, but at our expense. We are seeing the federal management of public lands become ill-suited to meet the wants and needs of local communities. Yes, I would discuss transferring some federal lands back to the states, for I hold to the belief that local control, and history provides us with plenty of examples, is far more advantageous than control from a distance.

They lack the wonderment and the curiosity to succeed in a quickly changing economy, and once lost, they are nearly impossible to restore. Education is hijacked by special interests, including education programs and boards that have monied interests to prevent good and very qualified people from entering the teaching field, unless they pay them for their services. We are now focused on ridiculous concerns because we fail to see what education has become and what it ought to be.

I believe better education is needed, better programs warranted to encourage, not discourage, giving birth, and a better system of support once a baby is born.

Something is changing in our society and I think it falls squarely on the immature manner in which voters, particularly elected officials, talk with one another, with how voters see one another, and how voters fail in their obligation to know the issues and vote well.

According to an April 15 Facebook post, Lamb said he is running to represent Montana in Congress to “limit government overreach and spending.” His other policy priorities included investigating corrupt politicians and elected officials, opposing abortion and taxes, and supporting the First and Second Amendments.\n\nAccording to Facebook photos, posts and media articles, Lamb has been a longtime supporter of the Bundy family, which orchestrated an armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. In 2020, he unsuccessfully campaigned to represent Senate District 36 in the state Legislature as a Libertarian.\n\nLamb did not list a 2022 campaign website on his filing with the Montana secretary of state and did not submit a completed candidate questionnaire to Montana Free Press.\n\nThis biography was compiled with information from Lamb’s Facebook page, news articles in which Lamb is quoted, and election result records from the secretary of state’s website.

We should be celebrating this high turnout, regardless of the electoral result. However, 19 states have responded by enacting laws that will make it harder to vote. That’s why we need federal legislation to ensure that regardless of where a voter lives, they have safe, secure, and reliable access to voting."

This corruption and purposeful neglect of working families is perpetrated by both parties. I will not hesitate to call it out every chance I get — on the campaign trail and in Congress.

As a Montana lawmaker I carried legislation to protect all Montanans with pre-existing conditions, end lifetime caps, and to negotiate lower drug prices. In Congress I will fight to increase funding for our rural hospitals and expand access to affordable mental health care. But in the end we must stop protecting Big Pharma and the insurance industry that profits by rationing health care to American citizens: Wholesale corruption in DC is the only thing stopping us from catching up to the rest of the world with true universal health care for all."

They considered it a redistribution of wealth from rich out-of-staters to working Montanans. I also wrote legislation for greater protections for renters and mobile home tenants. But the housing issue is just as much a wage issue. Working Montanans do not have the purchasing power to compete with the rich investors trying to buy up Montana. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage, end source of income discrimination, and expand access to capital for working families. Finally, we must use federal dollars to force cities to end discriminatory zoning laws, laws that have been manipulated by the rich to keep the poor and working class in substandard housing and away from their neighborhoods."

Zinke resigned from that position in 2018 after investigations into possible ethics violations, which Zinke dismissed as “false allegations.” In February, the department’s Office of Inspector General found that Zinke had misused his office but had not engaged in criminal conduct.\n\nSince leaving his federal position, Zinke has worked as a contractor for private companies, including ConocoPhillips, Cyber Range Solutions and JVL Enterprises of Dallas. \n\nBefore his election to Congress, Zinke was a state lawmaker in Montana. Zinke served as a U.S. Navy SEAL for over 20 years, retiring in 2008. \n\nThis biography was compiled with information from the secretary of state’s records, national news articles and reporting by KTVH on Zinke’s 2022 financial disclosure.

At the same time, we produced record volume of oil and gas, reduced emissions and had the strongest safety year on record. The government’s role should be to ensure a fair playing field for all forms of energy, not select winners and losers with regulations that drive up costs.

I’ll also work with colleagues to reorganize and reform the executive branch. As Secretary, I saw firsthand how bureaucratic, antiquated and, frankly, wasteful the federal government is. When you try to change anything the answer you’d get back is “Well, we’ve always done it this way.” It has to stop. Billions of dollars in grants go out with no oversight, just autopilot. Jobs are filled blindly without even considering if the tasks could be done better elsewhere. And at the Department of Defense alone there are more than 800,000 employees that aren’t military.

I’ve also worked to expand access to telehealth and mental health services for those on Medicare by introducing the Rural Telehealth Expansion Act that would expand Medicare to cover store-and-forward telehealth services to all 50 states and introduced legislation to reduce the cost of prescription drugs by shedding light on the practices of pharmacy benefit managers."

In Montana this has led to very serious problems for university, hospitals and student recruitment. One of the solutions would be for joint federal, state, and local cooperation on housing. Section 8 housing assistance should be expanded. A lot of Montanans live in modular, mobile, and manufactured homes and pay rent for the land they stand on. Several of these \"parks” have been recently purchased by a Utah-based corp that has raised rent and offers very poor service. One near me has dealt with serious water issues not resolved by out-of-state management. It's time for FNMA to stop providing cheap financing for such corporate efforts to monopolize dramatic rental increases. Incentives should be directed to homeowners to actually buy their parks as they do in Livingston."

I think the internationally supported 15% minimum tax rate is a start and would bring money from profitable corporations who are paying nothing. On the other hand, I disagree with the progressive move to cancel student loans debt. A loan is a loan, not a grant. Restructuring is one thing. Elimination is not right. Like the Wall Street Journal has stated, the repeated extension and \"temporary pauses\" have cost over 100 billion in money Congress has not appropriated. Universities and colleges have to be more responsible about encouraging students taking on debt. This is true particularly at the graduate level — borrowing tens of thousands of dollars to obtain jobs that pay little is irresponsible."

Thinking we are immune from a coup just because it is dressed up like a loud buffoon? The attempt to destroy our system of government was real. Second, the U.S. Communications Decency Act should be amended so big tech providers can be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by others on their platform, meaning they can be held liable for violent speech, disinformation or misinformation. Newspaper editors did what big tech should be doing: keep society calm by keeping a lid on extreme and disturbed speech. Third, all of us should honor democracy by defending it and debating it."

Individuals should make healthy choices and be encouraged to a greater degree by health providers through behavioral education when they interact. Individuals need to help the country and not just treat symptoms. Telehealth will help rural states like Montana and allow patients to be near to home and reduce travel. Providers need to pass the savings to consumers from fewer interpersonal interactions. I would support funding for updating telehealth equipment in rural hospitals and areas. A faster FDA drug review process should be tied to price concessions. Reduce the number of patents and limit how long they survive. Doing away with the prohibition of Medicare negotiating drug prices and allowing Medicare to exclude drugs from their formularies would improve bargaining and therefore lower prices."

Lenders utilizing those programs should provide more small balance mortgages (under $100,000) with reduced fees/costs and lowered down payment for first-generation buyers as part of those programs. The Community Reinvestment Act, along with the above programs, needs to strengthen and encourage banks to make loans that incorporate repairs. Modular, panelized and pre-cut homes can help house poor families or individuals. They cost less than on-site builds. The density requirements in cities need to be revisited with federal incentives to build more condominiums. Current restrictions on condominium lending are a problem to first-time buyers.

Because Congress is on the take and only does what big money, i.e., corporations, PACs, and lobbyists, want them to do. And they don’t want their subsidies/tax breaks reduced to help the deficit. The only way to reduce the deficit is to elect politicians who refuse to take corporate, PAC or lobbyist money as a candidate or in office. If I were elected because of my refusal to accept corporate, PAC or lobbyist money, and was free from that financial obligation, I could easily find numerous federal giveaways, i.e., subsidies for many businesses, tax loopholes, etc., affecting both conservative and liberal institutions. Recent large tax breaks for the wealthy should be repealed along with the dynasty trusts that shelter money for generations without paying taxes on increased value. Those would be a start to a balanced budget. I would ask for equal sacrifice from right- and left-leaning institutions."

Federal public lands in Montana and the west in general should be fertile ground for: developing renewable energy; establishing a Climate Conservation Corps; restoring public land; continuing sensible agricultural and water usage and practices; zero or reduced tillage; crop residue inclusion in fields; nutrient management; preventing organic matter loss; and soil erosion control. Climate change requires federal lands to be used for laboratories to help save the planet, not further exploitation by private industry.

Most have at least one superintendent and principal, and some can be consolidated with the money going to teacher pay. A second issue would be to allow school boards to run the schools. Trying to incorporate every parents’ wishes will only deteriorate the public school system. I cannot get three people to agree on a date for a church bake sale. How could teachers incorporate 30 parents’ requirements of what and how to teach? They can’t.

We all thought it was reasonable because some were hot-heads, but in the field, we were focused and no one acted out. In America, the hot-heads (mental illness, drugs, etc.) have easy access to firearms. A reasonable discussion about this issue brings out the lobbyists who only want to sell more guns and incite anger. The public wants reasonable restrictions.

It’s why I am working with Senators Graham and Blumenthal on federal policy addressing crimes against children. We need to talk to each other as neighbors and fellow Montanans. Civility has been lost in the highest levels of government, and the people’s trust has been compromised. Our politics are busted, but we’re not broken. I’m not blind to the problems, but I see the possibilities that lie within us and extend beyond us and I am committed to working for all Montanans. Together, we can put people over politics.

Updating and improving Medicare reimbursement is a step in the right direction as may be adjusting the age of qualification for Medicare. The high cost of prescription drug prices must be dealt with also, especially lifesaving drugs like insulin. Additionally, in rural Montana, doctors are few and far between. According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, 46 of Montana’s 56 counties are underserved by primary care doctors, and almost a third of Montana’s primary care doctors will retire by 2030, according to the Robert Graham Center. Medical programs to train doctors in western states help, but more needs to be done. That’s why I support S.1893, the Rural Physician Workforce Production Act of 2021. These are short answers to a complex question."

Infill development in urban areas helps lower infrastructure costs, preservation of rural housing helps avoid displacement in rural areas, and low income and workforce housing tax credits help incentivize affordable housing development. These are a few areas that can be addressed immediately to begin promoting housing affordability in Montana."

This is why I endorse an increase of the tax rate for the very wealthy, while keeping taxes at their current rate for families earning under $400,000. President Biden’s American Families Plan will raise $1.5 trillion over a decade by making the wealthiest 1% of Americans pay their fair share. The plan would also raise levies on capital gains and ordinary income and increase tax audits for those earning more than $400,000 a year. Long-term changes in spending and revenue require legislation, but executive actions can contribute to a sustainable fiscal future. For example, taxes paid must match taxes owed, not the average $381 billion/year tax gap."

There are good reasons to be skeptical though, as a recent report by Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit located in Bozeman, reveals. Transfer of federal lands to the states might produce more revenue, but it wouldn’t necessarily reduce expenses, especially when it comes to wildfire suppression and environmental planning. No one disputes that public lands offer many benefits ranging from recreation to resource development. But when costs go up, states will be tempted to sell off what had once been land accessible to everyone. I’m not alone in feeling that federal land should remain federal land. In fact, a report authored by the former Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke “does not recommend that a single acre of federal land be removed from the federal estate.”"

I support the IDEA Full Funding Act (S. 3213/H.R. 5984) and the Keep Our Pact Act (S. 72/H.R. 764). These create a mandatory 10-year path to fully funding both IDEA and Title I of the Every Student Succeeds Act.

Reproductive rights must be decisions between patients and their medical provider, not the government. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v.

According to a biography on his campaign website, Roots associated with skinheads and served time in federal prison for a gun charge in his early 20s. He writes that he went back to school after his release, ultimately earning a law degree and a PhD in sociology, and now runs an educational institution named after [19th-century anarchist Lysander Spooner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner).\n\nRoots has been a perennial Libertarian candidate, previously running for state auditor in 2020, Montana Supreme Court clerk in 2018, secretary of state in 2012 and 2016, and U.S. Senate in 2014. Roots was involved with the trial of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation defendant Ryan Bundy [as a “volunteer paralegal.”](https://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/08/montana_man_roger_roots_to_ser.html) Roots is licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, [according to the Rhode Island Bar Association](https://ribar.com/members/directory/?page=1&lname=Roots), but is not a member of the State Bar of Montana. \n\nRoots did not complete MTFP’s issues questionnaire. This biography is based on information presented on his campaign website, public records, news coverage, and his statements at a May 8 candidate forum.\n",

Because of term limits I can only serve four more years. Other states do not limit the PSC to eight years because they understand you’re limiting technical experience. The Legislature must end term limits for the PSC position or Montanans will continue to lose valued job experience. If the commissioner is not performing, you simply vote them out of office."

After that is factored in, I am one of the lower-paid positions at the PSC. We are looking to fill a staff position now that pays $30,000 more than my salary. Most Montanans assume the commissioner is the highest paid, it is not. Also, I spent $50,000 — or was it $80,000 — to win the race to have the position. Should not the reporter expect you to have to subtract that cost from your pay? Now I am the lowest paid person at the PSC. Also, think of the risk: you might pay $100,000 in campaign cost and not win at all. How many people do you know that will spend  $100,000 for a job interview for a job that only pays $100,000 a year when you pay most of your own expenses and only last four years? And then you may not get the job after you spent the money and over 1,000 hours of your time out on the campaign trail."

Judges imposing fines or ordering treatment paid by the Defendant makes little practical sense when it is obvious the person is financially incapable. Releasing an inmate after significant incarceration with little community support or supervision increases recidivism. In the criminal justice system, a substantial number of defendants have chemical dependency problems and/or mental health issues. The State’s support programs are inadequate, underfunded, and poorly operated. The judiciary could take a more active role in these programs to help address chemical dependency and mental health issues."

Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution mandates the public has the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of public bodies, including the judiciary, except when the needs of individual privacy clearly exceed the merits of public disclosure. Time and again the Montana Supreme Court has balanced the public’s right to know against the government’s right to not disclose the information.

Overall, the system is burgeoning at the seams, and still recovering from the delays caused by Covid. Increased filings are caused by root issues of chemical use/dependency and mental health, such as violent/sexual assault and child abuse, and crimes related to drug/human trafficking and gang activity. While the rate of increase in child neglect cases has leveled off, they remain high. Covid did bring a silver lining: more courts are using video technology to conduct cases remotely, increasing efficiency and coverage in rural areas. However, high caseloads have contributed to delays in case resolution, and with our growing population, the Legislature must consider creation of additional district courts to manage the need. The Court has approved, as a pilot project, rules for streamlined proceedings for minor civil cases and mediation for domestic cases to encourage prompt case resolution."

The study found no observed disparity in the LENGTH of incarceration sentences — specifically, felony property crimes, sexual/violent crimes, drug crimes, and DUI convictions were found to be racially neutral. The study did find there were differences between prison commitments VERSUS commitments to the placement discretion of the Department of Corrections for public order crimes, such as failure to register as a violent/sexual offender, and the crime of criminal endangerment, but cited the need for further data. In sum, the Court has been diligent to address racial disparity wherever it is found, such as jury selection, ensuring persons are not excluded from service on the basis of race. The advancement of tribal court systems and federal funding for tribal law enforcement promise to provide enhanced racial sensitivity."

But rights are not absolute; all are balanced against competing rights or limiting principles necessary to ensure that all constitutional provisions are given effect. The law gives greater weight to particular rights in different contexts. The right to privacy is generally considered broad, but in a case involving the public’s right to know, the law presumes government information will be disclosed, and a claimed privacy interest must give way unless significant enough to clearly outweigh the right of disclosure. Thus, a report about a public official’s malfeasance would not likely be outweighed by his privacy interest in his personnel file."

I have stressed these principles in judicial opinions, in public forums, and in a lawsuit I filed when the Legislature improperly subpoenaed the justices’ communications. However, this authority is not absolute, and the Court has no police force to enforce its orders. Rather, the Court draws requisite support from the citizens by staying within its own constitutional parameters: acting impartially, not legislating or making policy decisions, deferring to the work of other branches, and following precedent for predictability and stability. As Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox said, “The power of the Supreme Court to command support depends on a sufficiently widespread conviction that it is performing the functions assigned to it, and only those functions, in the manner assigned.”"

                "value": "I have 20 years of judicial experience—14 years as a District Court judge presiding over countless civil and criminal jury and bench trials, handling nearly 15,000 cases and 5 years on the Montana Supreme Court, participating in 1,100 opinions covering areas of law from city court appeals to constitutional challenges. I’ve been at the forefront of drug courts — starting two of Montana’s 36 drug courts including Billings’ first felony drug court which I presided over for nearly a decade. I’ve presented at state and national drug court conferences, written successful grant applications to fund drug courts, engaged in drug court peer reviews, served on the statewide drug court advisory committee, helped other judges establish drug courts and provided mentoring. I’ve also been at the forefront of child welfare work. I started and presided over a pilot child welfare court which significantly reduced terminations of parental rights and case processing times while maintaining child safety."

Despite this, workload studies identify a need for additional judges in some judicial districts. To add judges, the legislature must create these positions. The workload studies have been provided to the legislature along with requests to increase judicial positions. Although the legislature has not approved funding to meet the identified need, it is important to continue to monitor case filings and advocate for more judicial positions in districts showing the highest need."

            "question": "According to the most recent data analyzed by the Prison Policy Initiative, Montana’s incarceration rate in prisons, jails, immigration facilities and juvenile facilities is higher than the national average. Native American, Black and Latino people are also disproportionately represented in Montana’s jails and prisons. Do these trends represent a problem in Montana’s judicial system?

On behalf of the judicial branch, I served on the Justice Reinvestment Initiative which studied the impact of sentencing policies/practices, identified ways to safely reduce incarceration and promote evidence-based alternatives to incarceration, and considered disparities. From this, many legal changes were enacted but haven’t yet existed long enough to measure results. I am a member of the National Center for State Courts Judicial Evidence-Based Peer Group and MT’s Pretrial Advisory Committee. I’ve brought trainings to our judges on pretrial assessment and sentencing and am involved with a state pilot program to base pretrial release decisions on risk assessment. Finally, I served as our Court’s coordinating member for our recent racial equity study to investigate racial disparity across our criminal justice system, identify drivers of such, and make recommendations for the judiciary to address them."

The Montana Supreme Court has interpreted the balancing of these rights and has, given the significance of these rights, appropriately required balancing through fact-specific analysis of the interests to determine whether demands of individual privacy exceed the merits of public disclosure. For example, in Missoulian v. Brd. of Regents, the Court found public employees had a protected privacy interest in their performance reviews and then balanced such against the right to know, concluding privacy outweighed public disclosure. In Billings Gazette v. Billings, the Court further refined its interpretation of public employee privacy rights when addressing a request for the names of city workers disciplined for misconduct at work, again concluding privacy outweighed public disclosure as the employees did not hold positions of trust."

During my time on the MTSC, performance surveys show the Court earned a 90% approval rating for consistency, efficiency, and effective application of the law. The MTSC has constitutionally functioned as a check and balance to other government branches. A fair and independent judiciary is a cornerstone of democracy. To provide justice for all, maintain our rule of law, and assure our three branches of government work as our Constitution provides, judges must be able to act free of the pressures of partisan politics and other government branches. I am a Justice, not a politician, and I intend to continue to engender trust in and respect for our judicial system by continuing to be an impartial, independent jurist committed to upholding the unique rights of our Constitution, among them the right to privacy, public land and water access, and a clean and healthy environment."
