  "LedeIn": "The 2022 election will be the first in decades when Montana voters select not one but two U.S. representatives to advocate for the state's interests in Congress. Also up for the vote this year is control of the Montana Legislature, two seats on the state's utility regulation board and two seats on the Montana Supreme Court.\n\nThe first step for the political hopefuls was the **June 7 primary election**, where Montana voters chose nominees to represent each of the state's recognized political parties in the **Nov. 8 general election** (independent candidates could qualify for the November ballot if they collected enough signatures).\n",

  "BallotMeasuresIntro": "Two issues have qualified for the November general election ballot, both referred to voters by the 2021 Montana Legislature:\n\n- **[C-48](https://sosmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/C-48-Ballot-Statement-Language.pdf)** — Would amend the Montana Constitution to  specify that “electronic data and communications” are included in the clause that protects Montanans from “unreasonable searches and seizures.” Sponsored by [Sen. Kenneth Bognar, R-Miles City](https://apps.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2021/), the measure passed the Legislature last year with bipartisan support.\n\n- **[LR-131](https://sosmt.gov/wp-content/uploads/LR-131-Ballot-Statement-Language.pdf)** — An anti-abortion measure formally titled the Montana Born-Alive Infant Protection Act, specifying that any infant born alive “must be treated as a legal person.” It passed the Legislature with GOP support on near party line votes.\n\nBackers of several other measures sought unsuccessfully to place them on the 2022 ballot by initiative, but [weren't able to collect enough voter signatures](https://montanafreepress.org/2022/06/30/montana-tax-cap-measure-other-proposed-initiatives-miss-ballot/).\n\nMore information on proposed ballot measures is available [on the Montana secretary of state's website](https://sosmt.gov/elections/ballot_issues/proposed-2022-ballot-issues/).",
  "LegislativeIntro": "Montanans elect 100 state representatives to two-year terms and 25 of 50 state senators to four-year terms in each even-year election. In 2022, one additional Senate District (SD 15) is also on the ballot to fill the vacancy left by [Sen. Ryan Osmundson's appointment](https://montanafreepress.org/2021/09/07/montana-budget-director-kurt-alme-resigns/) as the governor's budget director.",
  "Outro": "Other Montana offices, including governor, secretary of state, attorney general and Jon Tester's U.S. Senate seat, aren't up for election until 2024.\n\n### About this project\n\nThis guide was produced by the Montana Free Press newsroom with design and web development by Eric Dietrich, editing by Brad Tyer and contributions from Amanda Eggert, Mara Silvers, Alex Sakariassen and Anna Ries-Roncalli.
