We need to be aggressive in making sure opportunities are available to workers, in a way that suits them, that also works for the business community. I believe the biggest area we can make an impact is through education."

I have long championed apprenticeship programs in Montana, since I was deputy commissioner at the Montana Department of Labor. In 2017 Governor Bullock and I passed legislation to provide tax credits to businesses hiring apprentices and I believe those efforts should continue. We should also look at expanding dual enrollment programs, free two-year college tuition and greater access to work-based learning opportunities."

The Republican-majority Montana Legislature has been studying our tax system for several interim sessions now and I would expect them to bring ideas to the table as well."
