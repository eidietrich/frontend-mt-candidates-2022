But the housing issue is just as much a wage issue. Working Montanans do not have the purchasing power to compete with the rich investors trying to buy up Montana. We must raise the minimum wage to a living wage, end source of income discrimination, and expand access to capital for working families. Finally, we must use federal dollars to force cities to end discriminatory zoning laws, laws that have been manipulated by the rich to keep the poor and working class in substandard housing and away from their neighborhoods."

No one disputes that public lands offer many benefits ranging from recreation to resource development.

Rights in America are to be protected, but the necessary obligation to do that well comes by way of proper education and citizenship."

I would be in favor of that, with the assumption we have the proper feedback mechanisms and infrastructure in place to respond. Government can tax for the money (not likely in a representative democracy), print money (not likely due to the fear of inflation), or it can borrow (which it currently does, mainly due to the fact most do not understand how this system works).

They lack the wonderment and the curiosity to succeed in a quickly changing economy, and once lost, they are nearly impossible to restore.

Unfortunately Ryan Zinke voted not once, but twice against requiring photo ID to vote. That is a matter of permanent public record, and he cannot run from that fact. In Congress, I will stand with the House Freedom Caucus to accomplish the policies which the majority of Montanans and Americans support — starting with ensuring that states have control over the administration of their elections, not the federal government as is proposed by Nancy Pelosi."
