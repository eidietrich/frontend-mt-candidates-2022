More importantly, I served as a legislator on the most important energy committees and now, with four years as a Public Service Commissioner, that's about the most experience you can have. Because of term limits I can only serve four more years. Other states do not limit the PSC to eight years because they understand you’re limiting technical experience. The Legislature must end term limits for the PSC position or Montanans will continue to lose valued job experience. If the commissioner is not performing, you simply vote them out of office."

After that is factored in, I am one of the lower-paid positions at the PSC. We are looking to fill a staff position now that pays $30,000 more than my salary. Most Montanans assume the commissioner is the highest paid, it is not. Also, I spent $50,000 — or was it $80,000 — to win the race to have the position. Should not the reporter expect you to have to subtract that cost from your pay? Now I am the lowest paid person at the PSC. Also, think of the risk: you might pay $100,000 in campaign cost and not win at all. How many people do you know that will spend  $100,000 for a job interview for a job that only pays $100,000 a year when you pay most of your own expenses and only last four years? And then you may not get the job after you spent the money and over 1,000 hours of your time out on the campaign trail."
